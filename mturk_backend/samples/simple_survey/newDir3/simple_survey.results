That sounds like an autobiography I would read because it sounds like there were dark times but then a journey back to life.  In Search of Truth, by contrast, sounds very spiritual in nature and not so much like a survival story.  I want the survival story to be gritty or raw or have depth and hell and back implies that.  A Journey of Survival is uplifting, but not necessarily something that I had to read."
