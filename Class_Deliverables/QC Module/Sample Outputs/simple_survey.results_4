Kind of reminds me of the Vote or Die campaign that P Diddy was a part of several elections ago.   Revolution: The Movement Forward for a Bipartisan America actual provides some insight into what the actual book will be about, which is helpful especially if someone is not going out looking for this book, and just looking at a whole section of books.  Join or Die is vague enough for it to not tell me anything about the content of the book, so I probably wouldn't pick it up off the shelf to take a look at it."	"Valid"
